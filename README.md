Image classification using logistic regression

In this notebook we will see how we can use tensorflow and keras to make an image classification model with logistic regression.

Why use logistic regression?
The advantage of using logistic regression is that not only we can classify entities into two categories but also it gives us probality of an object/entity 
to be in that class. This can be used further in model to adjust the parameters, and eventually minimize loss.

Here, I tried to classify images of Cats and Dogs.

You can also experiment with different parameters to achieve different results as needed.
